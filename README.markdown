### Ply: minimalist CSS library

### What you get:

* The *universal spacing reset rule* (`*{margin:0;padding:0;}`) for consistent cross-browser spacing.

* Minimal set of spacing rules to rebuild your page's natural intestinal flora after the spacing-reset antibiotic above (line heights/leading, ordered/unorderd lists, headers).

* Richard Rutter-style [cross-browser font-size normalization](http://clagnut.com/blog/348).

* 24 40px column grid system (960px width). 10px column margins. Bluetrip-style naming conventions. That's because I stole most of Bluetrip's grid code, though I did change some paddings into margins and fixed an IE6 double-float-margin. Even Ply's `ply-grid.png` is a wholesale lift of Bluetrip's `bluetrip-grid.png`.

* Commented and version-controlled. Each line documents the purpose of its own existence. Well, not yet fully. Soon.

* Default sans-serif font everywhere.

* Ugly but-not-totally objectionable table styling.

### What you don't:

* Full-blown Eric Meyer-style [reset stylesheet](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). No need to rebuild the world if your don't nuke it all in the first place.

* Typography. Tripoli is very pretty. For traditional document-based pages. It gets in the way with web apps, which Ply targets.

* Print styles.

* "Plugins"

### Browser Support

Ply is tested against IE6, IE7, IE8, Firefox 3, Safari 3 and Safari 4.

### TODO

* Documentation
* Build system for distribution.
* one point oh.
